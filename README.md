This code is designed for use with the following Colab Notebook https://colab.research.google.com/github/NoraGraves/AIAttackDemo/blob/main/FacialRecognitionDemonstration.ipynb in order to demonstrate white-box attacks on a facial identification network.

The included keras network came from the pretrained VGG faces network, and was fine-tuned on several celebrities. This network is designed for demonstration purposes only! Therefore, there are a limited number of celebrities included, with an attemp to be as diverse as possible, given the limited time.
